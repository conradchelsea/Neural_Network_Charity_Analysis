# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Project Overview
Helped Alphabet Soup's business team create a binary classifier to predict which of the 34,000 charity organization applicants would be successful if funded by Alpahbet Soup. 

To do this, we:
- Preproccessed metadata about each organization using Pandas ans Scikit-Learn's StandardScaler() for the Neural Network. 
- Compliled, trained and evaluated the Neural Network Model to calulate loss accuracy.  
- Optimized the model with TensorFLow to predict a target accuracy higher than 75%. 

## Resources
- Data Source: Alphabet Soup Charity Dataset charity_data.csv
- Software: Python, Pandas and Scikit-Learn

## Results
Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
