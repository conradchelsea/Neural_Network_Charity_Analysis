# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Project Overview
Helped Alphabet Soup's business team create a binary classifier to predict which of the 34,000 charity organization applicants would be successful if funded by Alpahbet Soup. To do this, we:

- Preproccessed metadata about each organization using Pandas ans Scikit-Learn's StandardScaler() for the Neural Network. 
- Compliled, trained and evaluated the Neural Network Model to calulate loss accuracy.  
- Optimized the model with TensorFLow to predict a target accuracy higher than 75%.
